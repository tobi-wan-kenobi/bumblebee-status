Most importantly: Many thanks for considering contributing to bumblebee-status! I am continuously amazed by the quality and creativity of the Pull Requests I get - many thanks!

One thing I need to mention: This is a project I am working on in my (limited) spare time. I try very hard to answer bug tickets and review Pull Requests as quickly as possible, but it might take days, in some cases even weeks, until I get around to doing so. I want to give every contribution the attention it deserves. Really: I am not ignoring you, I'm simply slow :-)

### Filing a bug
If you want to file a bug, simply open an issue and describe your problem. Things that help narrow down the problem are:
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant section of the i3 configuration
- Debug logs and console output of bumblebee-status

But even if you can't provide those, any indicator that something is not working as it should is much appreciated!

### Adding a new module or theme
If you want to add a new module, please have a look at [how to write a new module](docs/development/module.rst) and [how to write a new theme](docs/development/theme.rst). Then simply create a Pull Request and I will review the changes as soon as possible.

Thanks for reading until here! :)
